#       parse_log_line_regex.py
#
#   Defines the parsing function for reading a GC log line in JDK11 & JDK16
#   Returns a regex searchable string, the column names associated, and the datatypes of the columns
#   Updating this regex may appear confusing. I recommend you begin by seeing which capture fields already in place
#   apply to your line, then using a `__regex_or` to append the new grouping. Verify using the link below.
