## Configurations for plots
The following parameters can be found in some of the plotting functions. The list of the parameters for each function can be found below.
- `gc_event_dataframes` a list of pandas dataframes (gc event logs) containing information to be plotted
- `filter_by` You can adjust the filter by using `filter_by` = `function`, where the function takes in a row of a pandas dataframe (gc event log), and returns True or False based on the row's content.
 A typical filter_by function first checks if the column of interest is in the row, then checks if that column is populated with the correct value.
 - `group_by`- a string column name to create groups for each unique value found in that column. Those groups are given their own names and plot. Typical values include None (group by log), "EventName" (group by type of event), and "AdditionalEventInfo" (group by specific event categories).
 - `labels` - a list of strings that describe the list of log files passed in as the `gc_event_dataframes` parameter.
 - `colors` - a list of matplotlib colors, where len(colors) >= len(gc_event_dataframes). If left as None, a set of colors from a deterministic sequence will be plotted.
 - `column` the column in all `gc_event_dataframes` to search for datapoints to plot. Plots data on the Y axis.
 - `column_timing` the list of float or integer data representing the timestamps of the `column` parameter. Note: The expected unit for this column is seconds, and any deviation from this may have unexpected behavior. [ There is a known bug where using "DateTime" information collected from a gc log will cause any function relying on `intervals` of time to fail. This issue is going to be fixed. ]
 - `plot` - a `Matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot` object, which is returned from all graphing based functions. Using this as a parameter for a function in the same cell will plot the resulting information onto the same plot. 

---
## Special Parameters

 Some of the functions will also have the following, more specific parameters:

- `interval_duration` - a float or integer timing in seconds to describe the size of groups of data collected from the log file.
- `line_graph` - a boolean. If True, the plot will be in the form of a line graph. If False, then a scatter plot. Default = False
---
To set a plot to logarithimic, use the returned object, and call the function set_yscale('log') on it. Then, use plot.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ScalarFormatter()) to nicely format the  Example:

`plot = plot_scatter(gc_event_dataframes labels=labels)`

`plot.set_yscale('log')`

`plot.yaxis.set_major_formatter(ScalarFormatter())`

--- 
Note: all functions are defined [src.graphing.plotting](../graphing/plotting.py) unless mentioned otherwise.

# List of generated plots, and expected parameters


## 1. STW Pauses during program runtime: 

Uses the function `plot_scatter()`. This function is interchangeable with the function `plot_line()` if a line plot is desired, with the same parameters for both functions. The parameters are listed below for the functions, with the expected values to create the plot described by `1. STW pauses during program runtime` being described in paranthesis. The only required parameter is `gc_event_dataframes` 
    
    gc_event_dataframes (required)
    group_by            (Expected = None) 
    filter_by           (Expected = pauses_only)
    labels              (Expected = labels variable)
    colors              (Expected = None)
    plot                (Expected = None)
    column              (Expected = None)
    column_timing       (Expected = None)

Note: a `gc event log` is a pandas dataframe, containing labeled columns to describe fields in a recorded event, and each row representing a discerete event. A list of `gc event logs` are returned from the function `get_gc_event_tables()` in `read_log_file.py`, which is used to automatically parse log files. 

`plot_scatter()` / `plot_line()` parameters:

- **gc_event_dataframes**: `list` datatype. Each list entry is expected to be a `gc event log`. The `gc event logs` in the list will be parsed for the columns described by the parameters `column` and `column_timing` for Y and X data respectively, after filters have been applied.

- **group_by**: `str` datatype. Name of a column present in the `gc event logs`. If this parameter is provided, groups all repeated values from the specified column, such that every group has the same value in column '`group_by`'. Leaving this optional parameter as `None` defaults to creating 1 group per `gc event log` in the `gc_event_dataframes` list. Examples below

      group_by = "EventName"
      group_by = "EventType"

- **filter_by** : `function` datatype. A boolean function to be applied to each row of each `gc event log`. If the function evaluates to false, then that event will not be included in the resulting plot. A typical function first checks if the column exists before checking any values, as seen in the example below. If this check is not in place, a `KeyError` may be thrown.
        
      def pauses_only(row):
           if "EventType" in row:
               if row["EventType] == "Pause":
                   return True
       return False
        
       filter_by = pauses_only

- **labels** : `list` datatype. Each entry in the labels list describes the data in `gc_event_dataframes`, in order. Each entry in the labels list should be a `str` datatype. 

      labels = ["Monday log", "Tuesday Log", "Wednesday Log"]

- **colors** : `list` datatype. Each entry in the labels list picks a color for the output groups in the created plot, in order. If `None`, a set of discrete colors in the same order will be used. Each entry of this list is either a `str` describing one of the [matplotlib named colors](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html), or is an (r, g, b) triplet with values between [0-1] representing brightness on a scaled (0-255) range.

      colors = ["black", "darkslateblue", (1, 0.5, 0)]

- **plot** : `matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot` datatype. Each graphing function returns an instance of this plot object. Passing None creates a new figure. Passing an instance of a plot will keep all old data on the plot, and add the newly plotted data on top. Typically used to overlay two data sets with different column names.

      plot = plot_scatter(gc_event_dataframes)
      plot = plot_line(gc_event_dataframes, group_by = "EventNames")

- **column** : `str` datatype. The name of a column found in the list of `gc event logs`, representing the Y coordinate of data to plot. If `None` is passed, the default value for this parameter is `"Duration_milliseconds"`. 

      column = "Duration_milliseconds"

- **column_timing** :`str` datatype. The name of a column found in the list of `gc event logs`, representing the X coordinate of the data to plot. If `None` is passed, the default value for this parameter is `"TimeFromStart_seconds"`. 
      
      column_timing = "TimeFromStart_seconds"

    group_by            (Expected = "EventName") 
    filter_by           (Expected = pauses_only)
    labels              (Expected = labels variable)
    colors              (Expected = None)
    plot                (Expected = None)

## 3. Latency Heatmaps, Linear

Uses the function `plot_heatmap()`. The parameters are listed below for the functions, with the expected values to create the plot described by `3. Latency Heatmaps, Linear` being described in paranthesis. There are TWO required parameters: both `gc_event_dataframes`, and `dimensions` are needed for this function. The warning from matplotlib is expected. 

Important: The latency and time information is the LOWER bound of the bucket (square) on the heatmap. If you see a frequency of 3 for time = 0s and the next time square is labeled time = 10s, latency = 5ms and the next square above on latency is 10ms, then there were 3 pause events between 0 and 10 seconds, with latency 5-10 seconds.
    
    gc_event_dataframes (required)
    dimensions (Expected = [ 20,  15, 60, 10 ]) 
                                    ### 20 x axis columns
                                    ### 15 y column rows
                                    ### 60 seconds == 1 minute intervals
                                    ### 10 milisecond pause buckets 
    group_by            (Expected = None) 
    filter_by           (Expected = pauses_only)
    labels              (Expected = labels variable)
    column              (Expected = None)
    column_timing       (Expected = None)
    frequency_ticks     (Expected = True/False)

Note: a `gc event log` is a pandas dataframe, containing labeled columns to describe fields in a recorded event, and each row representing a discerete event. A list of `gc event logs` are returned from the function `get_gc_event_tables()` in `read_log_file.py`, which is used to automatically parse log files. 



`plot_heatmap()` parameters:

- **gc_event_dataframes**: `list` datatype. Each list entry is expected to be a `gc event log`. The `gc event logs` in the list will be parsed for the columns described by the parameters `column` and `column_timing` for Y and X data respectively, after filters have been applied.

- **-dimensions**-: a 4 length list, with the following values contained within the list
    - dimensions[0] = number of x intervals, or number of columns in the heat map
    - dimensions[1] = number of y intervals, or number of rows in the heat map
    - dimensions[2] = duration of a single x interval in seconds, or time duration of each column on the heatmap
    - dimensions[3] = duration of a single y interval in seconds, or time duration in each row of the heatmap.

Dimensions were choosen to be a required parameter rather than automatically set during runtime so comparion between multiple iterations of the tool would be easy to visually compare using the same X and Y axis scalings. Currently, there is a known issue where the color-bar frequency ranges may change between plots.

- **group_by**: `str` datatype. Name of a column present in the `gc event logs`. If this parameter is provided, groups all repeated values from the specified column, such that every group has the same value in column '`group_by`'. Leaving this optional parameter as `None` defaults to creating 1 group per `gc event log` in the `gc_event_dataframes` list. Examples below

      group_by = "EventName"
      group_by = "EventType"

- **filter_by** : `function` datatype. A boolean function to be applied to each row of each `gc event log`. If the function evaluates to false, then that event will not be included in the resulting plot. A typical function first checks if the column exists before checking any values, as seen in the example below. If this check is not in place, a `KeyError` may be thrown.
        
      def pauses_only(row):
           if "EventType" in row:
               if row["EventType] == "Pause":
                   return True
       return False
        
       filter_by = pauses_only

- **labels** : `list` datatype. Each entry in the labels list describes the data in `gc_event_dataframes`, in order. Each entry in the labels list should be a `str` datatype. 

      labels = ["Monday log", "Tuesday Log", "Wednesday Log"]


- **column** : `str` datatype. The name of a column found in the list of `gc event logs`, representing the Y coordinate of data to plot. If `None` is passed, the default value for this parameter is `"Duration_milliseconds"`. 

      column = "Duration_milliseconds"

- **column_timing** :`str` datatype. The name of a column found in the list of `gc event logs`, representing the X coordinate of the data to plot. If `None` is passed, the default value for this parameter is `"TimeFromStart_seconds"`. 
      
      column_timing = "TimeFromStart_seconds"

- **frequency_ticks** : `bool` datatype. If True, the heatmap prints the freuquency reported onto each non-zero cell. Default is False.

        frequency_ticks = False

                                    ### 60 seconds == 1 minute intervals
                                    ### 2 = log base 2

Note: a `gc event log` is a pandas dataframe, containing labeled columns to describe fields in a recorded event, and each row representing a discerete event. A list of `gc event logs` are returned from the function `get_gc_event_tables()` in `read_log_file.py`, which is used to automatically parse log files. 

`plot_frequency_of_gc_intervals()` parameters:

- **gc_event_dataframes**: `list` datatype. Each list entry is expected to be a `gc event log`. The `gc event logs` in the list will be parsed for the columns described by the parameters `column` and `column_timing` for Y and X data respectively, after filters have been applied.

- **group_by**: `str` datatype. Name of a column present in the `gc event logs`. If this parameter is provided, groups all repeated values from the specified column, such that every group has the same value in column '`group_by`'. Leaving this optional parameter as `None` defaults to creating 1 group per `gc event log` in the `gc_event_dataframes` list. Examples below

      group_by = "EventName"
      group_by = "EventType"

- **filter_by** : `function` datatype. A boolean function to be applied to each row of each `gc event log`. If the function evaluates to false, then that event will not be included in the resulting plot. A typical function first checks if the column exists before checking any values, as seen in the example below. If this check is not in place, a `KeyError` may be thrown.
        
      def pauses_only(row):
           if "EventType" in row:

Each entry of this list is either a `str` describing one of the [matplotlib named colors](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html), or is an (r, g, b) triplet with values between [0-1] representing brightness on a scaled (0-255) range.

      colors = ["black", "darkslateblue", (1, 0.5, 0)]

- **plot** : `matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot` datatype. Each graphing function returns an instance of this plot object. Passing None creates a new figure. Passing an instance of a plot will keep all old data on the plot, and add the newly plotted data on top. Typically used to overlay two data sets with different column names.

      plot = plot_scatter(gc_event_dataframes)
      plot = plot_line(gc_event_dataframes, group_by = "EventNames")

- **column** : `str` datatype. The name of a column found in the list of `gc event logs`, representing the Y coordinate of data to plot. If `None` is passed, the default value for this parameter is `"Duration_milliseconds"`. 

      column = "Duration_milliseconds"

- **interval_duration** : `float` or `int` datatype. The duration in seconds for grouping of times. For this function, that would be the period of time in which the gc events durations are summed

      interval_duration = 3600 # 1 hour
      interval_duration = 1.5  # 1.5 seconds

- **column_timing** :`str` datatype. The name of a column found in the list of `gc event logs`, representing the X coordinate of the data to plot. If `None` is passed, the default value for this parameter is `"TimeFromStart_seconds"`. 
      
      column_timing = "TimeFromStart_seconds"

- **remove_empty_intervals** : `bool` datatype. if True, then intervals where the sum of pauses = 0 will not be plotted. Default = False.

      remove_empty_intervals = False

- **line_graph** : `bool` datatype. If True, the graph plotted will be in line graph style, rather than scatter plot. If False or None, then it will remain scatter plot. Default False.

      line_graph = False
